I am finally back to blogging after a 7 month hiatus, and I promise I have a good excuse this time! In September I accepted an offer to work as a data scientist in text mining with [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.de/), the largest job board in Europe. While this involved some very difficult decisions about leaving my job at [SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au/) and my life in Melbourne, it is an amazing opportunity and so far I am really enjoying both the work and the city.

As you can imagine, the last 6 months have been consumed with packing up my life in Australia and setting up in Germany, so my time (and headspace) for professional development has been very limited! Happily I am now settled in Berlin and ready to get back to sharing some of the exciting things I have been learning recently in my job, as well as some projects I started before starting my German job hunt. Watch this space!
